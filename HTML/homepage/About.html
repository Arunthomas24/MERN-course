    <h1>About Our Business</h1>
  </header>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded: 2010</p>
      <p>
        We began as a small family-run poultry farm supplying fresh eggs and table birds to local markets. Over the
        years we've invested in improved housing, biosecurity, and feed formulations to increase productivity while
        maintaining animal welfare standards. Today we supply a network of retailers, restaurants, and community
        markets across the region.
      </p>
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide safe, nutritious, and affordable poultry products while promoting sustainable     
        farming practices. We aim to support local food systems by producing high-quality eggs and meat, reducing
        waste, and continuously improving animal health through responsible husbandry and vaccination programs.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Animal welfare: humane treatment and comfortable housing for all birds.</li>
        <li>Food safety: strict hygiene and traceability from farm to table.</li>
        <li>Sustainability: efficient resource use and waste minimization.</li>
        <li>Community: supporting local jobs and transparent relationships with customers.</li>
      </ul>
